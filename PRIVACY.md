Privacy Policy for Just The Instructions
Effective Date: June 16, 2025

Just The Instructions (“we,” “our,” or “the extension”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle data when you use our Chrome extension.

1. What data we access
The extension may access the text content of the web page the user is currently viewing in order to identify and return recipe information. This data is processed locally in the browser and may be sent to OpenAI’s API to generate a simplified recipe.

2. What we do with the data
We do not store, log, or share any data.

Website text is used only temporarily, and only for the purpose of extracting recipe information.

The data is transmitted to OpenAI’s GPT API for processing, and the result (the recipe) is shown to the user.

3. What we do NOT collect
We do not collect or access:

Personally identifiable information (name, email, etc.)

Web browsing history

Authentication credentials

Health, financial, or communication data

Location data (IP address, GPS, etc.)

4. Third-party services
We use the OpenAI API to process text and generate recipe outputs. Please refer to OpenAI’s policies for details on how they handle submitted data.

5. Data retention
We do not store any user data. All accessed content is processed in real-time and discarded after use.

6. Changes to this policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here.
